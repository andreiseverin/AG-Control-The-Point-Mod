Teams: Red/Blue (Recommened 3x3)


## Mechanics:

1. Stand on the pressure plate (Point) for 10 seconds to capture it.
- Uncaptured points are having white light.

- Captured points are having blue/red light corresponding to the team controlling them:

Blue team:

2. If players from both teams stand on a point the timer wont work.
 - If while capturing the point is left and then you or a teammate returns to the point, the timer will continue from the same point when you left.

Example: Player 1 leaves the Point at 4 seconds remaining.
        Grabs RPG and returns at the point.
        Countdown begins from 4 seconds left.

 - However if a player from the opposing team steps on the plate while you or your teammate is gone your timer will reset. When you try to capture the point it will start from 10.

 Round points will be displayed in the top of your screen with a HUD Message if you install the [@AG Control the point plugin](https://github.com/andreiseverin/AG-Control-the-point-plugin).

Win Condition:

Roundend is triggered when 1 team controls both points.
The round will end with a BIG BANG :)
